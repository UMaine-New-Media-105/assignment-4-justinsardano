assignment 4.1 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/cxmZFk-GO For this assignment, I created a custom shape using a loop. I added conditions that allowed the shape to change position and size, which allows me to add variety with one shape. 
assignment 4.2 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/-DJi4Nxx2 for this assingment, I created a pattern of the previous assignemnt, which was the custom shape created from a loop. To do this I had to create a loop that would create a 'grid' for the shape. Then I had to create two separate functions, one which was a function to create the basic shape and then a second to create the variety. 
assignment 4.3 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/gFEAZeFKQ For this assignment, I used the previous pattern I had made and randomized it. I did this by adding a random to the x and y coordinates of the shapes, and then randomizing the scale of each of the different color shapes.
